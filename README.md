# TrAC Tabular and Time-series Foundation Model Tutorial

This GitHub is for the TrAC tutorial on Tabular and Time-series Foundation Model.
There are totally 4 modules dedicated to different focuses. Each module has an
associated notebook coding tutorial including the introduction of different
attributes, classes, and experiments. 

## Module 1 Foundations of Tabular/Time-series Data & Limitations of Traditional Models

In this module, we detail the foundations and significance of tabular and time-series
in real applications. We also introduce existing methods for analyzing these data and
point out why trational models, particularly machine learning (ML) models, fail due to
the modern AI demand.

## Module 2 Tabular Foundation Models

Module 2 features several recent tabular foundation models and their working mechanism.
Especially, we will look at how in-context learning equips these models with excellent
zero-shot prediction capabilities.


## Module 3 Extension to Time-series Data via Tabular Foundation Models

In this module, we present how the TFMs introduced in Module 2 can be extended to time-
series data, which can be treated as dynamic tabular data. We will feature a couple models
and show how they work with different datasets.

## Module 4 Introduction to Advanced Applications and Final Assessment

Beyond the last three modules focusing on tabular data, this module focuses more on multimodalities,
including image, text, tabular, etc. Since they are advanced application, we only give introduction.
We also provide final assessment for participants.


**Note: some examples in these notebook are adapted from [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html)**
We also introduce a couple TFMs developed by the AutoGluon team.
